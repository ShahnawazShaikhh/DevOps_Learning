What are runners in GitHub Actions?
Answer:
A runner is a machine that runs the jobs in a GitHub Actions workflow. There are two types of runners:

GitHub-hosted runners: GitHub provides the virtual machines, and these runners are managed by GitHub.
Self-hosted runners: These are machines that you manage and host yourself. They can run on any environment (e.g., local server, cloud VM).
